Technique: LSTM or Long Short Term Memory networks are an extension for Recurrent Neural Networks with explicitly extended memory capability well suited to handle long term dependencies. In the domain of chatbots for time series conversations, LSTM is shown to perform well and maintain the context for longer durations.

Purpose: Answer the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) by prospective college students during out-of-hours.

Benefit: The students tend to connect to the college's peer mentors in their convenience. If the students are coming from different parts of the world, the difference in time zones creates a problem for both the students and the mentors. Hence, the development of a chatbot in taking questions offline is imperative in solving these issues.

How it works: LSTM-based neural network is trained on
the dataset. The questions are tagged to the extracted data. This creates a question-answer dataset for training the chatbot.  

Results: The results yielded a high accuracy score, inline with the correctness of the chatbot in answering the queries.

Caveat: More dataset could have been included if we were given a longer time.
